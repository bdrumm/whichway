# Porting ledger: iOS → Android

The iOS app leads. Android catches up in occasional, isolated port passes; nothing here is ever a reason to
change `ios/`. This file records what each Kotlin file mirrors and the iOS commit it was last brought level with,
so the next pass knows exactly what moved.

**Last port pass:** iOS at `aa492fd` (2026-10-10).

`scripts/ios-drift.sh` lists the iOS files changed since that commit, with the Kotlin file each maps to.

## Ported

| iOS source | Kotlin (`android/…`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Models/Schedule.swift`, `Models/Geometry.swift` | `core/…/Schedule.kt` | `client_lines.json` parsed by hand (array rows) |
| `Models/GTFSRealtime.swift` | `core/…/GtfsRealtime.kt` | same wire decoder, no protobuf dependency |
| `Models/Alerts.swift` | `core/…/Alerts.kt` | |
| `Core/Predictor.swift` | `core/…/Predictor.kt` | checked against the iOS fixture to 1e-6 |
| `Core/LineBoard.swift` | `core/…/LineBoard.kt` | `VehicleHistory` is an instance, not a singleton; derived positions (a train with no vehicle report is placed by its trip update, or "at the terminal, not yet departed") |
| `Core/StationGraph.swift` | `core/…/StationGraph.kt` | complex names tie-break alphabetically (Swift: dictionary order) |
| `Core/Planner.swift` (itineraries, headways, `evaluate`) | `core/…/Planner.kt` | |
| `Core/PlatformTiming.swift` | `core/…/PlatformTiming.kt` | |
| `Core/Presets.swift` | `core/…/Presets.kt`, `app/…/store/Stores.kt` | model and store |
| `Core/Places.swift` | `core/…/Places.kt`, `app/…/store/Stores.kt` | |
| `Core/Habits.swift`, `Services/HabitStore.swift` | `core/…/Habits.kt`, `app/…/store/Stores.kt` | with the Swift tests |
| `Core/PersonalModel.swift`, `Services/PersonalModelStore.swift` | `core/…/PersonalModel.kt`, `app/…/store/Stores.kt` | |
| `Core/BoardingDetector.swift`, `Core/TripTracker.swift` | `core/…/TripTracker.kt` | with the Swift tests; plus `forecastTrainDeparted`: the feed drops a train a few seconds before its predicted platform moment, which left the Swift freeze rule waiting for ever (Oct 9, 3:00:49 against 3:01:05), so the forecast and the plan's train freeze when the planner moves on at the platform (iOS adopted the same rule in d9ccec1; `TripRecorder.forecastTrainDeparted`) |
| `Core/LineInference.swift`, `Core/OnTrain.swift` | `core/…/LineInference.kt` | with the Swift tests |
| `Core/Planner.swift` (ride half) | `core/…/Planner.kt` | `ridingItinerary`, `plannedCandidate`, `connectionItinerary`, with the Swift tests |
| `Services/TripRecorder.swift` | `core/…/TripRecorder.kt` | pure; the app feeds it sensors, fixes, feeds and the clock |
| `Services/MotionSampler.swift` | `app/…/trip/MotionSampler.kt` | gravity + linear acceleration at 25 Hz, in g |
| `Services/TripActivityService.swift`, `WhichWayShared/TripActivityAttributes.swift` | `app/…/trip/TripService.kt` | a foreground service (type location) with an ongoing notification in place of the Live Activity |
| `Views/PlannerView.swift` (route in progress) | `app/…/trip/TripSession.kt` | start/end, the plan's trains, the ride's itinerary, following the train boarded / the stop got off at / staying on, the rider's word, auto-start by GPS |
| `Views/OnTrainSheet.swift`, `PathViews.swift` (departure board) | `app/…/ui/TripViews.kt` | trip bar, boarding prompt, line chooser, on-train sheet, departure board |
| `Services/Telemetry.swift`, `Services/TripRelay.swift` | `core/…/TripObservation.kt`, `app/…/store/Telemetry.kt` | the record, the switch (on by default), the local server and the relay; no rider's-own-GitHub-token path |
| `Views/RouteHealth.swift`, `Views/LineHealth.swift` | `core/…/RouteHealth.kt` (logic), `app/…/ui/PathViews.kt` (badge, row) | |
| `Views/TrackDiagramView.swift`, `MareyChartView.swift`, `RouteMapView.swift`, `PathViews.swift` (hours, mini track), `PredictionChart.swift` | `app/…/ui/Charts.kt` | Compose Canvas; the map draws the published track geometry with no street tiles (a tile layer needs a provider decision) |
| `Views/PathViews.swift` (view switcher, hold outlook, scenario picker), `PlannerView.swift` (leg diagram, path detail, insights), `RouteInsightsView.swift` | `app/…/ui/PathViews.kt` | the insights sheet is a condensed version |
| `Views/WelcomeView.swift` | `app/…/ui/WelcomeView.kt` | with the sharing switch |
| `Views/SettingsView.swift` (sharing, Developer's trips section) | `app/…/ui/SettingsScreen.kt` | |
| `Services/LocationService.swift` | `app/…/store/LocationService.kt` | platform LocationManager; the foreground service keeps the fixes coming during a route |
| `Views/CommuteViews.swift` | `app/…/ui/CommuteViews.kt` | chip, setup prompt, editor, nearby sheet, Settings section |
| `Views/PlacesViews.swift` | `app/…/ui/PlacesViews.kt` | places, editor with the pin, pace section |
| `WhichWayShared/Format.swift`, `RouteStyle.swift` | `core/…/Format.kt` | colours as ints; Compose bullet in `app/…/ui/Common.kt` |
| `Services/DataService.swift`, `DiskCache.swift` | `app/…/store/AppData.kt` | a 404 from the published site retries the other known bases, including the raw `gh-pages` branch (Pages was publishing the source branch on 2026-10-09, so `/data/` was a 404) |
| `Views/PlannerView.swift` | `app/…/ui/GoScreen.kt` | the three pages (home, line, routes) under the corner glow, or the classic page (Settings › Go tab › Classic layout, `classicGo`); pickers, commutes, habits, walk line, ranked routes, the details dialog in place of the sheet |
| `Views/HomeViews.swift`, `Core/RouteConfidence.swift` | `app/…/ui/HomeViews.kt`, `core/…/RouteConfidence.kt` | home card, journey bar, strand view, mini strands, glow wash and `boardingUrgency`; route confidence, journey segments, `nextItineraryAfter`, `stopsToGo`/`stopsAway` |
| `Views/LineBoardView.swift` | `app/…/ui/LineScreen.kt` | board, health row, engine chart, scenario picker, alerts, train rows; not the leg tabs that follow the Go tab's route (`TrainFocus`), the route chart or the alerts-affecting-route list |
| `Views/SettingsView.swift` | `app/…/ui/SettingsScreen.kt` | the rider page and the Developer page (data source, status, build); commutes, places, pace and sharing sections not yet |
| `Views/WelcomeView.swift`, `ContentView.swift` (first-launch sheet) | `app/…/ui/WelcomeView.kt`, `MainActivity.kt` | no sharing switch: Android records no trips yet, so the sheet says that instead |

## Not ported yet (in rough order of value)

- **Motion traces** (`MotionTrace`, Debug-only on iOS) and the route-health badge on the Now card (`RouteHealth`).
- **Polling with the app gone**: the feeds are polled by the activity's view model, so a route survives the screen going off (the service holds the sensors and fixes) but not the activity being destroyed. Moving the poller into the service is the fix.
- **Line tab follows the Go tab's route** (`TrainFocus`/`FocusLeg`, `LegTabs`, `RouteChart.swift`, `alertsAffecting`): the Line tab is a plain line picker on Android.
- **Street map tiles** under the route map (MapKit on iOS): the geometry alone is drawn.
- **The rider's own GitHub token** (`GitHubUploader`, the way before the relay) and the JSON export (`ShareLink`): the relay covers the upload.

## How a port pass goes

1. `scripts/ios-drift.sh` to see what changed on iOS since the last pass.
2. Port those changes into the mapped Kotlin files (or move a row up from "Not ported yet").
3. `./gradlew :core:test` (and `:app:assembleDebug` with the SDK installed).
4. Update **Last port pass** above to the iOS commit you ported from, and commit only `android/` (plus `.github/workflows/android.yml` if it changed).
